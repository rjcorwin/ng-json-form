# Angular JSON Forms Example 

- The code for the NG JSON Form Module which exports the NG JSON Form Component https://github.com/rjsteinert/ng-json-form/tree/master/src/app/ng-json-form
- Example use of NG JSON Form Component in an App Component. Note how when the NG JSON Form Component emits its `jsonFormSubmit` event, the App component handles that event and assigns the resulting data to `results` which then causes that data to be shown in the App Component Template. https://github.com/rjsteinert/ng-json-form/blob/master/src/app/app.component.html
